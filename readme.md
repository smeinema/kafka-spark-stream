# Play Project to connect Apache Kafka and Spark Streaming

For a Luminis Tech Day we play around with Apache Kafka and Spark Streaming.
Some colleagues put up a Kafka cluster.
Others produce a messages on a topic based on the Twitter API.
This project consumes those messages and puts them into Spark Streaming.
